	Batman is a little lonely. despite the billons of dollars and being a superhero, the dark knight has trouble connecting with other people - probably because of that time his parents were murdered.
	Alfred takes it upon himself to help batman make some relationships, namely with that kid he forgot he adopted - who gets a costume of his own to wear.
